    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-3">Methodology</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        This project employs advanced machine learning methodologies to accurately predict the productivity of garment workers based on multiple performance-related factors. Our approach is structured as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:</strong> We utilized a comprehensive dataset which underwent rigorous cleaning and preprocessing to resolve missing values and correct inconsistencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Categorical variables such as department and day were encoded into numerical formats to facilitate effective model training.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Development and Evaluation:</strong> A suite of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were developed and rigorously evaluated to determine the most effective predictive model.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> The optimal model, XGBoost, has been deployed within this web application framework using Flask, enabling practical, real-time productivity prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-3">Objective</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
        The primary objective of this initiative is to equip managers and human resources professionals with a reliable, data-driven tool to support strategic decision-making. By leveraging predictive insights into employee productivity, organizations can optimize resource allocation, enhance operational efficiency, and drive organizational excellence.
